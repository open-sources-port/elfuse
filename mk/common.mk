# Git hooks, installed on the first make of a fresh clone.
#
# The hooks run the same checks CI does, at commit and push time instead of
# after. Left to "make install-hooks" they are enforced on whoever read the
# README carefully, which is not the population that needs them; the cost of
# being wrong is a symlink, and uninstall-hooks removes it.
#
# Once per tree, not once per build: the stamp is what keeps a rebuild from
# re-running this, and a hook removed by hand stays removed until the next
# clean. A target rather than a read-time side effect, so a dry run or a query
# leaves the checkout untouched. A tarball export has no git dir, which the
# script exits 0 on. Where it does fail, and it can, the recipe below swallows
# the status rather than the build stopping over a symlink.
#
# Hung off compilation and the help screen rather than off MAKECMDGOALS.
# Naming the goals would give every one of them a rule, including the
# misspelled ones: a typo that stops today with "No rule to make target" would
# instead find an empty rule, report nothing to be done, and exit 0. A build
# system that succeeds on "make check-fromat" is a worse trade than installing
# a symlink one command later.
#
# Every binary this tree builds reaches the two object rules below, host unit
# tests included, so one order-only prerequisite there covers every build
# entry point without listing any of them. help covers the case that builds
# nothing, which is what a bare make prints. clean, distclean and the two hook
# targets reach neither, so they skip this without being named.

# reach the hooks directory returns non-zero and leaves no stamp, so the next
# make retries rather than remembering a failure as done; an unwritable build/
# fails the touch and is likewise retried. Neither can fail the build, which is
# what the trailing no-op is for: hooks are a convenience, and a checkout that
# cannot take them still has to compile.

# Objects compiled with -fsanitize=... cannot be linked into a binary built

# ___asan_version_mismatch symbols that names neither cause nor cure. The
# sanitizer targets clean before they build, but nothing cleans after them, so
# the next ordinary "make elfuse" walks into it. Record the flavor and wipe the
# tree when it changes: the rebuild was unavoidable either way, since every
# object is instrumented differently, so this costs nothing beyond making the
# reason legible.
#
# Evaluated while the makefile is read rather than as a target, because the
# sanitizer lanes reach $(ELFUSE_BIN) through their own prerequisites and never
# run a phony guard hung off the elfuse target. Getting that wrong is worse than
# no guard: the stamp stays stale, the link succeeds, and an instrumented binary
# is handed back to a caller who asked for a plain one.

#
# print-% is in the list because those goals only print variables, and because

# deletes the directory it is writing into and the analyzer dies on the next
# translation unit.
#
# What survived is the question, not how find reported it. Both of find's
# answers are to a different one: -delete descends into that same report
# directory, so an unreadable entry there exits non-zero with every removal
# having succeeded, and a removal that failed silently is invisible to stderr.
# Stopping is the point. Carrying on writes a stamp claiming a flavor the
# leftover objects do not have.
# Only the host objects and the dependency files that belong to them. A find
# over the whole tree also takes the .d files of the cross-compiled guest
# binaries, which are built with CROSS_TEST_CFLAGS and so have no flavor: the
# binary survives the wipe while the record of which headers it depends on does
# not, and editing tests/test-harness.h then stops rebuilding any of them. That
# was invisible while the sanitizer lanes still depended on "clean", which
# removed binary and .d together; dropping that prerequisite made the mismatch
# permanent, so the wipe's unit has to match the flavor's unit.
#
# A .d does not sit beside its object. DEPFLAGS above writes it flat under
# build/ with the path separators replaced by underscores, so the object
# build/syscall/casefold.o is described by build/syscall_casefold.d. Deriving
# the name by suffix substitution alone names a file that has never existed on
# this tree, which is a wipe that silently keeps every stale record it claims
