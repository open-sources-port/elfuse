/*
 * The synthetic USB tree's contract, and the two views that must agree
 *
 * Copyright 2026 elfuse contributors

 *
 * Code under test: src/runtime/usb-sysfs.c, plus the sysfs statfs arms in
 * src/syscall/fs-stat.c.
 *
 * Two halves. The first asserts what holds with no USB device attached at all:
 * SYSFS_MAGIC from statfs and fstatfs alike, the read-only open contract, and
 * the ENOENT/EINVAL/ENOTDIR answers for paths the tree does not carry. Those
 * run everywhere, so a machine with an empty bus still regression-tests the
 * path layer.
 *
 * The second half walks whatever devices are present and asserts the identities
 * that can only be checked against a real one -- above all that the
 * `descriptors` attribute and a read() of the matching /dev/bus/usb node return
 * the same bytes, which is the invariant Linux keeps between sysfs and usbfs
 * and the one a second blob generator would silently break, and that the
 * `subsystem` links the tree emits are reachable the way Linux makes them
 * reachable: followed on a plain open, ELOOP only when the caller asked for
 * O_NOFOLLOW, and readable as a target either way.
 *
 * A run with no devices is not a pass by default: the device count is printed,
 * so a lane that quietly stopped covering the second half is visible rather
 * than merely green.
 *
 * What the second half cannot cover, whatever is plugged in: an attribute value
 * this layer never produces. `configuration` is the case in point -- it needs a
 * configuration whose iConfiguration is non-zero *and* a string descriptor read
 * over ep0, and no device can supply the second half of that to a layer that
 * opens nothing. Asserting the value here would only ever assert the empty
 * case, so the rule itself is asserted in test-usb-desc-host.c against
 * synthesized descriptors, which runs both branches on any host, and what stays
 * here are the two facts a real device can falsify: that the attribute exists,
 * and that it is empty whenever iConfiguration is 0.

 * -- every guest starts at pid 1, so all eight lanes spell the same name; the
 * uniqueness has to come from the filesystem that holds the plant. The plant is
 * what makes the assertions non-vacuous, and it is used two ways: readlink of
 * it by its own name must succeed, so a plant that never got created cannot be
 * mistaken for a refusal; and it must not appear in anything the tree hands
 * back, which is how the escaping shape is caught -- a descriptor opened on the
 * escape lists the planted name, naming the host directory it reached rather
